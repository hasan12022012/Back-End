                Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing artists .Beryl’s pictures feature women of
                all shapes and sizes enjoying themselves .Born between the two world wars, Beryl Cook eventually
                left Kendrick School in Reading at the age of 15, where she went to secretarial school and then into
                an insurance office. After moving to London and then Hampton, she eventually married her next door
                neighbour from Reading, John Cook. He was an officer in the Merchant Navy and after he left the sea
                in 1956, they bought a pub for a year before John took a job in Southern Rhodesia with a motor
                company. Beryl bought their young son a box of watercolours, and when showing him how to use it, she

                It is often frustrating to attempt to plan meals that are designed for one. Despite this fact, we are
                seeing more and more recipe books and Internet websites that are dedicated to the act of cooking for
                one. Divorce and the death of spouses or grown children leaving for college are all reasons that
                someone accustomed to cooking for more than one would suddenly need to learn how to adjust all the
                cooking practices utilized before into a streamlined plan of cooking that is more efficient for one
                person creating less.
